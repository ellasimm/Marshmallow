• Developed a simulation of an airline reservation system in Java using Microsoft Azure SQL in which a user can search, add, or delete a flight booking in their accounts   through an interactive UI.
• In addition, an Admin has access to insert a flight, delete a flight, or delete a booking for a user.
• Integrated object-oriented programming concepts and exception handling into the flight and database code.
